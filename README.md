## Disclaimer

This is my personal pet project which is currently under heavy development (WIP). For the moment I have the following goal in mind:

I think libp2p is a great technology which has a lot of opportunities. Although I have a lot of experience in cloud technology and
backend, I have not (yet) a lot of experience in libp2p itself, coroutines, kademlia, and such. So the current goal of this project 
is educational for me, meaning I do not guarantee functionality, stable interfaces or operation without any bugs/issues.
